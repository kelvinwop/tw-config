101174=1. There are many resource spots on the world map, which can be found using the search function. \n2. You need to send units to the resource spots to gather resources. \n3. Gathered resources can be used to upgrade components to improve Unit Suppression. \n4. Every time you gather resources, you have the opportunity to obtain a large amount of tech items. \n5. Units of different levels can collect different amounts of resources. \n6. Each resource spot has a time limit, but it will not disappear when you are in the process of gathering. \n7. We are working to improve the gathering function. You are more than welcome to leave comments. Thank you.

Defeating one level grants you the opportunity to challenge the next level, and the max level is Lv. 5. Higher difficulty grants greater rewards!\n\n★Droid Shards/Activating Droids\n1. After a senior member has selected a Droid type, the alliance members need to donate Droid Shards to boost the Droid deployment. Donating shards will grant you Donation Rewards as well!\n2.

After the Droid is defeated, it will enter the "Damaged" status, which lasts 30 minutes. You can attack it during this period and the damage still counts towards the damage ranking. Rewards will be sent by the end of this period. \n4. There's a time limit on the Droid. If you failed to defeat the Droid within the specific time, you won't be able to get the reward!\n\n★Truce Period\n1.

cross_server_intro=I. Overview\n\n1. Matching Stage:\nThe system will match opponent Warzones based on ranking points 1 week before the battle begins. Every 2 Warzones will be matched as opponents. Commanders can view the opponent server in the EVENT tab.\n\n2. Donation Stage:\nAt the Donation Stage, Commanders can obtain Military Supplies in the Individual Points Ranking Rewards of the Arms Race. Military Supplies can be donated to the "Frontline Battlefield" located at the corner of the map to help friendly NPC's. After the Donation Stage ends, the server that donates the most supplies will own the Frontline Fortress.(Each day at 16:00 (GMT), the system will remove the remaining Military Supplies. Please donate in time.)\n\n3. Preparation Stage:\nAt this stage, if one server conquered a Frontline Fortress, the commanders of this Warzone can Teleport to your opponent's cross-warzone area. (Commander cannot interact with anything on cross-warzone at this stage)\n\n4. Battle Stage:\nAt this stage, the Commanders of the 2 Warzones will attack to conquer their opponent's Capital. On the map, Commanders need to conquer the fortress of an area first. When conquered the fortress of an area, Commanders can teleport to their territory and interact with objects in this area. Only the fortresses adjacent to the conquered area can be attacked.\nFrontline Fortress is a special fortress. It doesn't require a Conquest Period, and you can attack it even if it's not in an adjacent area. When conquered, your server will take over the ownership of it (and it is counted in the number of conquered areas in the event tab), and it can take you to the opponent's cross-Warzone area. However, you cannot teleport to your cross-Warzone area, you can only attack the opponent in the area.\nTo attack the Capital or Missile Launch Facility, Commanders must take over at least 1 fortress adjust to them.\nIf 1 server successfully conquered opponent's Capital, the Battle Stage will end immediately.\nIf both servers failed to conquer their opponent's Capital, then the Warzone that conquered more areas wins.\nIf the numbers of the areas conquered by both Warzones are the same, then both servers fail.\n\n5. Award Stage:\nAt this stage, Commanders can collect rewards in the event tab based on their performance in the cross-Warzone war. The rewards for cross-server war victory and killing ranking will be sent automatically.\n\n\nII. Special Notes\n\n1. Some events will be closed temporarily:\nAt the Battle Stage, Supply Contest and World Boss events will be closed temporarily.\n\n2. Some Alliance features will be closed temporarily.\nAt the Battle Stage, some Alliance features will be closed temporarily. Commanders won't be able to create, join or quit an Alliance, and no access to the Alliance Tech donation as well.\n\n3.Coss-server Chat is enabled:\nThe commanders of the 2 opposing Warzones can chat in the cross-Warzone chat channel.\n\n4. Strategic Retreat feature\nIn the event tab, commanders can tap the "Strategic Retreat" to return to their original Warzone. Once a commander uses Strategic Retreat, the commander will lose half of the units, so use it with cautious! Generally, Commanders can teleport between the 2 Warzones via the Frontline Fortress they've conquested.\n\n5. Abdication of Leader\nIn the Battle Stage, if the Capital of a Warzone is conquered by their opponent, then the Leader of the conquered Capital will abdicate and the Warzone will have no Leader until a new Leader is decided in the next Capital Contest.

The Warzone which donates the most items will get the initial ownership of the Frontline Fortress, which can be used to teleport to the opposing Warzone.\n\nTips: each day at 16:00 (GMT), the system will delete unused Military Supply items from your inventories. Please donate in time!

activityDes_108=1. During the event, commanders can use Gems to participate in the lottery. Each draw gives an item reward, a set of lucky icons, and 10 treasury points.\n2. At the beginning of the event, there are 2000 Gems in the Gem Treasury. Each time a commander participates in the game-wide lottery, 3 gems will be added to the prize pool. The Gems in the prize pool will be shared by all commanders, meaning other commanders' draws will also add Gems to your prize pool.\n3. Get the lucky icon to get different proportions of Gems in the Gem prize pool (see the reward preview for details). When there are fewer than 2000 Gems in the Treasury, the system will boost it up to 2000.\n4. Each time you participate in the lottery, you will receive treasury points. When you accumulate a certain number of points, you will get 1 Hero Shard.\n5. The grouping of the ranking list is as follows: Group 1 - S1 ~ S500, Group 2: S501 ~ S1,000, Group 3: S1,000 and above.

When conquered, your server will take over the ownership of it (and it is counted in the number of conquered areas in the event tab), and it can take you to the opponent's cross-Warzone area. However, you cannot teleport to your cross-Warzone area, you can only attack the opponent in the area.\nTo attack the Capital or Missile Launch Facility, Commanders must take over at least 1 fortress adjust to them.\nIf 1 server successfully conquered opponent's Capital, the Battle Stage will end immediately.\nIf both servers failed to conquer their opponent's Capital, then the Warzone that conquered more areas wins.\nIf the numbers of the areas conquered by both Warzones are the same, then both servers fail.\n\n5. Award Stage:\nAt this stage, Commanders can collect rewards in the event tab based on their performance in the cross-Warzone war. The rewards for cross-Warzone war victory and killing ranking will be sent automatically.\n\n\nII. Special Notes\n\n1. Some events will be closed temporarily:\nAt the Battle Stage, Supply Contest and World Boss events will be closed temporarily.\n\n2. Some Alliance features will be closed temporarily.\nAt the Battle Stage, some Alliance features will be closed temporarily. Commanders won't be able to create, join or quit an Alliance, and no access to the Alliance Tech donation as well.\n\n3.Coss-Warzone Chat is enabled:\nThe commanders of the 2 opposing Warzones can chat in the cross-Warzone chat channel.\n\n4. Strategic Retreat feature\nIn the event tab, commanders can tap the "Strategic Retreat" to return to their original Warzone. Once a commander uses Strategic Retreat, the commander will lose half of the units, so use it with cautious! Generally, Commanders can teleport between the 2 Warzones via the Frontline Fortress they've conquested.\n\n5. Abdication of Leader\nIn the Battle Stage, if the Capital of a Warzone is conquered by their opponent, then the Leader of the conquered Capital will abdicate and the Warzone will have no Leader until a new Leader is decided in the next Capital Contest.
cross_server_battlefield_008_tz=Commanders can get Military supplies from the points rewards in the Arms Race event and donate them to the activated Frontline Battlefield.\n\nBy the end of the donation stage, the Frontline Battlefield will turn into the Frontline Fortress. The Warzone which donates the most items will get the initial ownership of the Frontline Fortress, which can be used to teleport to the opposing Warzone.\n\nTips: each day at {hour:0}:00, the system will remove the remaining Military Supplies from your inventories. Please donate in time!

hero_name112=Friedman Hertz
hero_desc112=Friedman Hertz is the descendant of the famous physicist Heinrich Hertz, one of the core members in Freedom League and a scientific giant who pioneered new understandings of electromagnetism. He used the instrument he invented to trace the hideaway of the Dark Empire, which directed the way for the expedition. Meanwhile, he created the super weapon lab and conducted a research on the 115# underground element - the Odinium.

adventure079=No matter where we are, we'll continue to evolve. It's time for a new adventure, one that takes us into the depths of the Dark Legion's lair to learn the mysteries of alien civilization. We've decided to explore further than ever before!
adventure080=The Frozen Fortress was a base for the production of Components and mechanical parts, but is now conquered by enemies. Eliminate the enemy to get reward and resources!
adventure081=The treasures left behind by technologically advanced alien civilizations have brought many great benefits, but the mysteries and dangers of this world are just as plentiful. Many adventurers have set out and never returned. This is a temporary residence for most of the survivors. You'll find plenty of technology-related clues here.
adventure082=The North is famous for its unique terrain, which inspires unlimited combat potential for the various factions. It has a wide field of vision and makes for a vast battlefield, highly suited to mid- and long-range combat. Furthermore, scattered bunkers provide additional opportunities for forces to encounter each other, meaning that troops are constantly facing tests of life and death. It's also the best area for military exercises and there's tons of actual combat experience to be gained!
adventure083=The only route through to the South, this is the largest plain on the Sarandes continent. Its mountains and rivers are home to a variety of strange creatures and beautiful, exotic flowers and plants, but hidden people are the real unknown factor here.
adventure084=This area miraculously escaped the Armageddon tens of millions of years ago and is home to a group of carefree humans who have lived in this paradise ever since. This place once represented the summit of all the ancient scientific and technological knowledge of the Skori civilization, but the World War many years ago changed everything...
adventure085=The Mande Straits is an essential crossing for those traveling to the New World by sea, and its strategic position is very important. Some in the Freedom League call it the strategic heart of the world. According to legends, the straits was formed by an earthquake, during which many people drowned. The Straits is said to have complex navigation channels, dense reefs and innumerable shipwrecks. People believed that conquering the Mande Straits was the first step towards conquering the world.
adventure086=The Lava Rift lies in the southern part of the Sarandes continent and its history can be traced back to antiquity. But nothing resists the passage of time. The once glorious Lava Rift has steadily declined since its peak. The rift is teeming with all types of robbers, speculators and wanderers, as well as troops from the various factions stationed here. The morals and laws of civilized society are nowhere to be found.
adventure087=Here sits the once prosperous Verdun Fortress. Since the war, only the ruins of the wall remain, along with a few old people who don't want to leave their homes. The effects of the war have transformed the Verdun area into hell on earth.
adventure088=This is the last stop on the way to the new continent. It carries the passions and dreams of myriad expeditions. For them, the future has no limits. Unknown technologies, mysterious treasures, boundless lands... the adventure isn't over yet!

alliance_boss_010=HOW TO PLAY\n★Droid Types\n1. There are many types of Droids, and each type grants different rewards. R4 and above members should discuss carefully and decide which Droid you would like to activate.\n2. There are various difficulty options for each type of Droid. Defeating one level grants you the opportunity to challenge the next level, and the max level is Lv. 5. Higher difficulty grants greater rewards!\n\n★Droid Shards/Activating Droids\n1. After a senior member has selected a Droid type, the alliance members need to donate Droid Shards to boost the Droid deployment. Donating shards will grant you Donation Rewards as well!\n2. When the progress bar reaches maximum, an R4 or above member needs to activate the Droid at the proper time!\n\n★The Droid Battle\n1. Commanders are required to cooperate with each other to defeat the Droid.\n2. After each battle, you need to wait for a while before you can enter the next one. Please manage your time wisely!\n3. After the Droid is defeated, it will enter the "Damaged" status, which lasts 30 minutes. You can attack it during this period and the damage still counts for the ranking. Rewards will be sent by the end of this period. \n4. There's a time limit on the Droid. If you failed to defeat the Droid within the specific time, you won't be able to get the reward!\n\n★Truce Period\n1. After a Droid is activated and challenged, the Droid will enter the "under maintenance" status, but in the meantime, you can activate the Droid that is not under maintenance.\nLancer - Alpha: 12 hours\nLancer - Gamma: 2 days\nLancer - Delta : 4 days\nLancer - Epsilon: 7 days\n\nRestriction\nNewly joined members need to wait 24 hours before they can donate and challenge the Droid, and they won't be able to get any rewards either.

treasure_contents020=The mysterious Olmec culture of Central America flourished around 800 - 600 BC, also known as La Venta culture, mainly distributed in the Gulf Coast area. The biggest achievements in Olmec culture are the stone statues and stone carving arts. The works are of a very high level, generally large in size, strangely conceived, and proportioned. These avatars are carved from a whole piece of basalt, well-conceived, and have strong realism.
treasure_contents021=Prajna is a kind of ghost in Japanese legend. More precisely, it is a kind of resentful spirit. It is said that it is an evil spirit formed by women's strong jealousy and resentment. That is to say, the body of Prajna is a living person, but because of strong jealousy, the living beings come out of the body (living refers to the temporary separation of the living person’s soul from the body) and turns into a ghost to harm people. She herself doesn't even understand this process, but subconsciously feels that this is just a dream. After driving away the evil spirit in his heart, the prajna mask naturally fell off and disappeared.
treasure_contents022=In the history of cryptography, the Enigma Cipher Machine is an encryption and decryption of files. It consists of three parts: A keyboard, a display, and a rotor. It includes many different models for stream encryption of cryptographic symmetric encryption algorithms. Shelbyus wanted to use modern electrical technology to replace the manual encoding encryption method, inventing the machine that can automatically encode.
treasure_contents023=Hansin Plum Vase is a rare treasure in blue and white porcelain of the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. The Yuan Dynasty was an important period that cannot be ignored in the history of Chinese ceramics. The Yuan Dynasty was a regime established by the Mongolians. The Mongolians have a cheerful, generous, and informal character. They live a life on horseback. Therefore, the porcelain craftsmen at that time created blue and white paintings with typical drama stories as the theme to express the political significance of the Holy Master and the Magistrate. The creation of Hansin Plum Vase has a close relationship with the social customs of that time.
treasure_contents024=Garuda is a Tibetan, bird-like creature with gold wings. Feeding off dragons and snakes, it has become a Buddhist protector. Also known as Garuda in ancient Hindu mythology, it resembles a gigantic eagle-like bird with a fierce temperament. There are many different images of Garuda. In the ruins of Shanqi, India, Garuda is but a simple bird in shape. However, most images passed down to later generations have heads, claws, and beaks like an eagle, bodies, and limbs like humans, with a golden torso.
treasure_contents025=Triceratops, a genus of herbivorous dinosaurs in the order Ceratopsidae, Ornithodontida. The fossils found in North America belong to the late Maastricht and late Cretaceous, about 68 million to 65 million years ago. Triceratops is one of the most well-known dinosaurs and is often used as a representative fossil of the Late Cretaceous. For a long time, the function of their three horns and the head shield has been in dispute. Traditionally these horns have been considered as weapons against predators, but recent theories suggest that these horns may be used in courtship and a display of dominance.
treasure_contents026=Pharaoh of the 19th dynasty of Egypt, outstanding politician, strategist, writer and poet of the 19th dynasty of Egypt. The ruling period was the last strong era of the new kingdom of Egypt. Ramses II carried out a series of expeditions to restore Egypt's rule over Palestine. He had a conflict of interest in Syria with the Hittite, another powerful empire of his time. Ramses II is perhaps the most famous pharaoh in Egypt. His passion for the massive civil engineering projects around Egypt has left its mark. His many new temples in Abydos and Ramesseum. new structures added to the Karnak and Luxor Temple and the magnificent temple of Abu Simbel are some examples of his projects. Many structures built by previous generations of pharaohs have also been engraved with his name.
treasure_contents027=The Dragon Head, one of the bronze statues of the beast heads of the zodiac, was originally a part of the fountain outside the Haiyan Hall of the Yuanmingyuan Palace. It was cast during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. According to data, the bronze statue of the Chinese zodiac in Haiyan Hall, the Western Building of Yuanmingyuan, was designed and produced for the Emperor Qianlong under the guidance of French Catholic missionaries. From the copper engravings drawn by the missionaries, it can be clearly seen that the bronze figures of the zodiac signs are lined up left and right, six each, representing the twelve hours in a day and night. At every hour, a bronze statue of the zodiac representing this hour automatically spewed out of a fountain. At noon, the twelve bronze statues sprayed spring water at the same time. These bronze statues were designed by Westerners and made in China, blending Eastern and Western culture.
treasure_contents028=Ramesses II was the most famous pharaoh in ancient Egypt, and Nefertari was the most famous and the only queen among his eight queens. Nefertari has made some contributions in diplomacy. Regarding the life experience of Nefertari, historians have two different views. One version claims that she is the granddaughter of Pharaoh Ay, who succeeded Tutankhamen, and another version says that she is the daughter of a hereditary noble of Thebes. Abu Simbel describes her: [Whom the sun shines]. In some legends or literature, Ramses II is said to have many loving words to her.
treasure_contents029=[Admonitions Scroll] is a silk painting by Gu Kai of the Eastern Jin Dynasty in China. The original work has been lost. There are copies of the Tang Dynasty. There are 12 original sections. Due to the long age, there are only 9 sections remaining, which are used to color the silk. The work depicts female deeds. There are stories about Feng Yuan protecting the emperor Han Yuan in the Han Dynasty. There are stories about Ban Jieyu's refusal to share with the Han emperor to prevent the emperor's lust for women. Although the work contains the moral creed that women should abide by, the depiction of daily life such as the makeup and dressing of higher-class women, truly and vividly reproduces the delicate and reserved manners of noblewomen, regardless of their posture, manners, and clothing conforming to their identity and personality. [Admonitions Scroll] successfully shaped the image of court women of different identities, to a certain extent, reflecting the scene of women's lives in the author's era.
treasure_contents030=Qianlong was emperor in the Qing Dynasty of China. He was a well-known politician and strategist of the Qing Dynasty who had a total of sixty years before and after his reign, from 1736 to 1795. The royal armor is luxuriously decorated, with exquisite materials and fine workmanship, and is mainly used for large parades. This set of Qianlong Great Armor, although more than 200 years old, is intact and brightly colored.
treasure_contents031=The Katana has been known as a weapon since ancient times and is also known for its curved shape. Many famous Katanas are collected as fine arts and imply the soul of the samurai. Different from the blades of other countries, one of the biggest characteristics of Japanese blades is that the blade of Katana shows an artistic sense. The shape of the Katana has only changed greatly since the late Heian period, from a straight blade to a machete. The straight blade is perfect for piercing and the machete is perfect for slashing. It's mainly because of the change in combat style. Since late Heian, blades are constantly being improved for mounted combats.
treasure_contents032=The Stone Lion is a common evil-repellent item in traditional Chinese culture. The stone is used as a raw material to sculpt the image of a lion. It is a sculpture with artistic value and ornamental value. The earliest Stone Lion was the Stone Lion in front of the tomb of Gao Yi in the Eastern Han Dynasty. It is a kind of decoration often used in traditional Chinese architecture, and it can be seen in Chinese palaces, temples, and seals. But more often, Stone Lions refer specifically to a pair of lions placed on the left and right sides of the gate. In Chinese culture, the lion is more of a mythological animal than a real-life animal, and it has become a Chinese spirit beast together with the unicorn.
treasure_contents033=Shang period Mu Wu Ding, also known as Si Mu Wu Ding and Simuwu Quadripod, were cast from the late Shang period (about the 14th century to the 11th century) in China, and the heaviest known bronze ware in ancient China. The casting of Wuding, fully shows that the bronze casting in the late Shang Dynasty was not only large in scale but also tightly organized and meticulous in division of labor. It was enough to represent the highly developed Shang Dynasty bronze culture, which shows the internal inheritance of ancient Chinese bronze civilization.
treasure_contents034=Tang Sancai, a popular pottery in the Tang Dynasty, was glazed in yellow, brown, and green. Later it developed into a variety of colors, but it is still called Tang Sancai. In the prosperous age of the Tang Dynasty, everything was unique. And this Maitreya Buddha has a natural and relaxed form, but his expression shows his feelings of entering the world. Some people say that this happens to reflect the Buddha's concern and care for all beings, and it is more close to the original intention of Buddhism.
treasure_contents035=For many parts of the world, White Elephants have always been a symbol of strength and miracles. The monarchs in Southeast Asia attach great importance to them, because before the Buddha was born, his mother had dreamed of a White Elephant. However, White Elephants are also troublesome - as gifts from kings, they are noble and cannot be used for animal power, and the cost of raising one is extremely high. Since the seventeenth century, the painted porcelain "Kakiemon Elephants" has been highly regarded in the world. However, there are still many unsolved mysteries about its creators.
treasure_contents036=The Changxin Palace Lamp in the Western Han Dynasty, the bronze ware of the Han Dynasty in China, has changed the mysterious and heavy bronze wares of the past. The entire shape and decoration style are stretched, light and gorgeous, and it is a practical and beautiful treasure. The bronze statue of the maiden is hollow. The hollow right arm and the sleeve form a copper lampshade, which can be opened and closed freely. The smoke generated by the combustion can be deposited in the maiden's body through the maiden's right arm, and will not be scattered into the surrounding environment. The concept embodies the wisdom of the ancient Chinese people, and the Changxin Palace Lantern is known as the [First Lamp of China].

mail_content19079=Congrats! The {2} ({0},{1}) is held by your Alliance now. Please accept the reward for the First Holder of this Ruin below:
sp_world_fortress_help_001=Ruins - How To Play
sp_world_fortress_help_002=Ruins Campaign is a game mode for Alliances.
sp_world_fortress_help_003=When a battle occurs in the Ruins, the battle rules for Player VS Player will apply. But 80% of the attacker's damaged units will be sent to the Repair Factory.
sp_world_fortress_help_004=After garrisoning the ruins for 1 hour, the holder will take over the ruin and the ruin will enter a timed Truce period
sp_world_fortress_help_005=After successfully taking over the ruin, the ruin may either gain Alliance members attributes or features.
sp_world_fortress_help_006=You can attack any ruins, and there's a limit on Ruins you can hold at different levels, you cannot hold more ruins if you reached that limit.
sp_world_fortress_help_007=Limit on Ruins in the Outermost area: 3
sp_world_fortress_help_008=Limit on Ruins in the Middle area: 2
sp_world_fortress_help_009=Limit on Ruins in the Innermost area: 2
sp_world_fortress_help_010=Attributes gained from the Ruins are effective only in your Warzone
sp_world_fortress_help_011=After the truce period ends, if other Alliances failed to take over the ruin held by your Alliance within 24 hours, your Alliance will keep that ruin. If another Alliance is trying to take over the ruin, this Alliance has to hold the ruin for 1 hour to finally take over the ruin.
sp_world_fortress_help_012=When a ruin is "At war", the attributes won't take effective and the feature will be deactivated
sp_world_fortress_help_013=When the ruins are at peace and the Alliance is giving up the ownership of the ruin: If the remaining time for "At Peace" status is more than 1 hour, this status will last 1 hour after it's abandoned. If the remaining time for "At Peace" status is less than 1 hour, it will apply this remaining time after it's abandoned.
sp_world_fortress_help_014=Also when an Alliance gives up the ownership of a ruin, members of this Alliance will not be able to attack/compete for this ruin in a certain period of time
sp_world_fortress_help_015=By giving up the ownership of a Ruin, you cannot attack this ruin for a certain period of time regardless of the status of this ruin
sp_world_fortress_help_016=Changing of the ownership will not reset the Cooldown of the ruin function, which means after the reset, if "Alliance A" used the function and later the ruin is taken by "Alliance B", "Alliance B" can use the function after the reset at {hour:0}:00.

In return, the old man gave him a sword study guide "Akazuna's Hidden Secret" and the Japanese sword "Tora (the Tiger)". It wasn't until then he realized that this old man in front of him was a Kendo master, who devoted his life to the art of the sword. He named himself after his master, and started to explore the secret of Kendo. Then the war came, Akatora resolutely joined the Freedom League.

veteranplayer_tips19=About the Event
veteranplayer_tips20=1. During the event, an invitation code will be generated for each commander, which can be shared with commanders who have not logged in for a long time. The invited commander can log in to the game and bind your invitation code through the welcome back event.\n2. The more commanders that bind with your code, the more rewards you'll receive. If the commander you invited is active enough, you can get even more rewards.\n3. Qualified accounts for Welcome back event: account that has not logged in for more than 14 days (before the start date of this event).\n4. Each invitation code can be bound with up to 50 accounts.\n5. One code for one account ONLY. Which means returning players can't bind two different codes to two different characters under the same account.\n6. If there is more than 1 character under the same account doing the missions, the highest points earned will be counted.\n7. Points for Welcome back missions: commanders who have not logged in for a long time will receive Welcome back missions. 1 point for each mission completed.
veteranplayer_tips21=1. Once the commander you invited has bound your invitation code and completed any of the Welcome back missions, you will see the progress here.\n2. If there is more than 1 character under the same account doing the missions, the highest points earned will show here.
veteranplayer_tips22=1. During the event, bind the invitation code you got from another player to receive a reward and activate the exclusive welcome back event.\n2. There are 5 welcome back missions in each stage, and a new stage becomes available each day. All welcome back missions can be unlocked on day 5.\n3. If you have completed the tasks in the locked stages, you can receive rewards when the stage is unlocked.\n4. If your account is qualified for this event, you can create a new character under this account and reach Lv. 10 to participate in this event, but one invitation code for one account only! (thus if you have bound 1 code for your main, you can't bind with another for your alt) \n5. You can't bind a code generated from a character under same account (for example, you can't use your main's code for your alt).\n6. One code for one account ONLY. Which means you can't bind two different codes with different characters under the same account.\n7. Qualified accounts: accounts that have not logged in for 14+ days (at the start date of this event) \n8. The reward of the Welcome back mission is determined by the commander level when the event starts.\n9. When binding with the invitation code, if the character level is above 60, the Welcome Back pack will be available for you.

They lived joyfully in a beautiful mountain cabin. When the poachers killed JJ's parents and were ready to capture JJ, Grandpa intervened and rescued him. That brings back memories of her youth, when she was in the same circumstances. Mei chose to study Kung Fu from her grandfather to protect the weak. Over time, JJ seems to have learnt Kung Fu while drinking, eating and being with Mei. During the investigation of Ahenarbe, the SaND agents encountered Mei. The Agents hoped these strong eastern powers would join the battle against the Dark Empire. In the end, Grandpa had to allow Mei and JJ to leave their home and join the military.

newbase_gameplay018=After connecting with Agent Black Widow, the Task Force embarked on a journey to find all the secrets on the island. The goal has become clear: first things first, we need to find those Atmospheric Manipulators.
newbase_gameplay019=Surprisingly, there is a new desert outside the rain forest, full of rocks that are eroded by the wind. Is this all caused by that horrible Atmospheric Manipulator? Let's figure it out.
newbase_gameplay020=Passing through the desert there is the Mountain they have named the Sacred Mountain. The Sacred Mountain is covered with ice and snow, and we have no idea what's waiting for us there. Anyway, we must restore the Island as best as we can!
newbase_gameplay021=The Northern part of the island is a forbidden area for local residents only, it looks like a place of ceremonial gathering. You discovered the purpose of the Atmospheric Manipulator is to create extreme weather above the enemy. What monsters!
newbase_gameplay022=There's rough terrain, a powerful stronghold, fierce firepower and the base of the Dark Legion lying in front of us... All Dark Forces have garrisoned within the base here. This shall be our Top War with the Dark Forces.
newbase_gameplay023=Let's walk those poor residents home. We can easily occupy the Beachhead area by the South Island. So the new task is to keep the horrible Atmospheric Manipulator for yourself.
newbase_gameplay024=The rainforest here is more dangerous than before, hearing gun shots deep in the forest from time to time... With eliminating all the enemies and finding the last Atmospheric Manipulator you are going to liberate and bring peace back to the Island.

newbase_gameplay031=Inter...rence...uncont...tower...cloudy...
newbase_gameplay032=The interference is too strong. That large silhouette over there could be the giant tower the agent mentioned. Let's take a look.
newbase_gameplay034=Look! Clouds are coming out from the top of the tower. What is happening here?
newbase_gameplay035=...Elec....master...
newbase_gameplay036=Agent, please repeat! where are you? We need your location, Agent? ah... oh no. It looks like we are on our own now.
newbase_gameplay037=Take cover! The dark legion is here. Prepare yourself!
newbase_gameplay039=Aha! That's right, dark force, you better run! Now I need to figure out how to stop this stupid machine.
newbase_gameplay040=mmm Lucky! I wonder what it is?
newbase_gameplay042=Well done, Task Force. We have learned the giant tower is the Dark Empire's secret weapon. It interferes with the magnetic field and lets the Dark Empire control the weather. I call it the Atmospheric Manipulator.
newbase_gameplay043=Agent, Finally! The signal is back. What is the plan?
newbase_gameplay044=Hurry! Clear out all hostiles around the Tower, I'll contact you later. Remember to remove everything you can from the tower.
newbase_gameplay045=Commander! Now our mission is to take over the island and reveal all the secrets it has to offer.
newbase_gameplay046=And other side quests. Make sure to regularly check the task board.
newbase_gameplay048=What is it?! Lightning!
newbase_gameplay049=Thunder. Agent Black Widow reporting for duty.
newbase_gameplay050=Mission completed. Agent, shall we head back?
newbase_gameplay051=The task continues. Dark Legion has a command post right there. After I destroy all the enemies I will share more information.

newbase_gameplay090=I hope he is still breathing. Come on boys, let's go and check!
newbase_gameplay092=Looking at all the supplies and buildings, it would seem there is almost no room left on this island.
newbase_gameplay093=There are still some Dark Legion remnants on the South Island. We will do our best to eliminate them so we can expand our territory. Win-win!
newbase_gameplay095=A lot Agent! tons of supplies...
newbase_gameplay096=These are the supplies left by the Dark Legion. We can definitely put them to good use!

newbase_gameplay134=Commander, I found those papers.
newbase_gameplay135=It is a Tech Plan! It is essential for Tech research. Let's upgrade the command post to level 5!
newbase_gameplay136=Take over the Command Post so that we can research Tech, build Barracks, Shipyards, Air Bases and train more troops!!
newbase_gameplay137=Gold? It's a gold coin, amazing.
newbase_gameplay138=Hey hey, easy. This is a Gold Harvester. The Dark Empire used it to refine gold and produce gold coins.
newbase_gameplay139=Now they belong to the Freedom League. Let me try it.
newbase_gameplay140=Gold mines are essential to produce more gold coins!
newbase_gameplay141=You need to keep moving forward to explore this tile, it's too far and you can't reach it right now!

newbase_gameplay149=The South Island is surrounded by a delightful deep blue shine. You can place certain decors there, but you can't place naval units.
newbase_gameplay150=Please explore the area at the current location first.
newbase_gameplay151=Thanks to the woman Papa Oak met. She promised us she would send you the letter. I looked at her, and all I could think of was you.
newbase_gameplay152=Hope she's not fooling us and you receive this letter.\n\n
newbase_gameplay153=Stand as tall as tall as the trees, live strong like the mountains, be as gentle as the spring winds, keep the warmth of the summer sun in your heart, and the great spirit will always be with you.
newbase_gameplay154=G!
newbase_gameplay155=The Freedom Legion's men are all wearing Big Boots. They couldn't walk fast enough in the woods.
newbase_gameplay156=Their tactics are strange... Freedom League?? they wouldn't even allow us to walk around or even leave a message... But I will write to you as I wish, they will never find out!
newbase_gameplay157=They do not understand the forest. They need us, or else they are doomed to decay on the forest floor.\n\n
newbase_gameplay158=I know this is not my destiny. No matter what happens, I have to live in the present.
newbase_gameplay159=Dear G
newbase_gameplay160=The forest is resisting these Big Boots. I will try to teach them, ask them not to offend the forest... I hope the forest won't be mad at us.
newbase_gameplay161=I still need some time. Say hello to Mama Oak for me. I will be back soon. I promise.\n\n
newbase_gameplay162=I wish we could choose which memories to remember.
newbase_gameplay163=Dear Gyrafine with your luscious Black Hair:
newbase_gameplay164=The clouds curl again today, just like your hair.
newbase_gameplay165=We are moving... The Freedom Legion is looking for something and taking us through the Smoky Forest, a thick smog covers the forest floor, it is hard to breath but even harder to see.
newbase_gameplay166=I tried to convince them it is dangerous.. But the Big Boots won't head my advice... I'm fearful for what follows...\n\n
newbase_gameplay167=Eventually, our inner courage will decide who we truly are.
newbase_gameplay168=I don't want to enter the Smoky Forest, It wants to punish us and I WILL make it home!!
newbase_gameplay169=The Big Boots are wearing scary evil masks, and can walk through the woods with ease!!
newbase_gameplay170=The Big Boots forced us to take it with us... The forest must think that I am a traitor...\n\n
newbase_gameplay171=We are actually the same...
newbase_gameplay172=I am worried their machine will destroy the forest... Nature will punish them for their recklessness... They will all be cursed.
newbase_gameplay173=Now they have asked me to carry what they found. How I wish I could see you again.\n\n
newbase_gameplay174=They already passed by here and have no idea what they missed.
newbase_gameplay175=Dear Gyrafine my Shining Star:
newbase_gameplay176=My love, I am alive. It has been a long time since I wrote you last.
newbase_gameplay177=We have arrived at the North Sea. The seashells are beautiful, almost like they don't belong. The shells shine like the sun... I'm keeping it for you.\n\n
newbase_gameplay178=I have late night conversations with the moon, he tells me about the sun and I tell him about you.
newbase_gameplay179=It's been about 314 or 315 days since I joined the Freedom Legion.
newbase_gameplay180=The Big Boots have built another weird building here, it's spitting out smoke!
newbase_gameplay181=Smoke covered the sky, creating dark clouds. The Big Boots are trying to hide it, but I saw it for myself.\n\n
newbase_gameplay182=Don't ask me the goal of this game. Finding the goal is the entire meaning of the game.
newbase_gameplay183=Papa Oak is not feeling well these days... He's too tired, and there's hardly any chance to rest.
newbase_gameplay184=But it's not a big problem, I can definitely take care of him! Don't let Mama Oak worry. My Gyrafine... I miss you!\n\n
newbase_gameplay185=I am but a speck of dust in this vast universe.
newbase_gameplay186=Dear Quiet Quiet Gyrafine:
newbase_gameplay187=I think at this moment you are peacefully sleeping. I'm upset... The other day Papa Oak wanted to keep the Big Boots away from the Great Mountain... They hurt him...\n\n
newbase_gameplay188=I need tears to tear me in two so these nightmares can escape me.
newbase_gameplay189=I don't have much time today, I have to finish my work and go take care of Papa Oak. He's in bad condition yet he's still optimistic about everything, reminds me of you. Maybe he is right, perhaps we still have a chance.\n\n
newbase_gameplay190=Fate is in our hands but only the brave ones can hold it.
newbase_gameplay191=My Warmest Gyrafine:
newbase_gameplay192=The Big Boots were the ones who built the strange building on the mountain! The mountains are all white, I'm so cold... I've never needed to wear so many clothes in my life...
newbase_gameplay193=But it's still cold here... I miss you, I miss your warm smile... I can hardly write... My hands are shaking...\n\n
newbase_gameplay194=I miss my animals. I miss my family. I miss my friends.
newbase_gameplay195=Papa seems better now. But the Big Boots won't let him rest... I will pick up his jobs...
newbase_gameplay196=And, we have come up with a plan! I'll tell you next time, see you later!!\n\n
newbase_gameplay197=The worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you feel all alone.
newbase_gameplay198=Dear Gyrafine My Strong Girl:
newbase_gameplay199=I cant believe it, never would I have imagined it, but the Big Boots lied to us!
newbase_gameplay200=Papa was badly injured... Those bastards!!! Please pardon my language... But they are destroying our home, building those horrible machines, everywhere!!\n\n
newbase_gameplay201=Some are destined to endure an endless darkness.
newbase_gameplay202=G. They are forcing us to lead them to the Forbidden Area... and I'm doing everything to distract them...
newbase_gameplay203=G... I had the chance to take Papa back home...I...May he find peace and love in the land of our ancestors...
newbase_gameplay204=G. I told myself to be strong. Like you are.\n\n
newbase_gameplay205=Who we are. And who we want to be... Is not always the same.
newbase_gameplay206=Gyrafine:
newbase_gameplay207=Papa Oak came to me, it has been 331 days. The Big Boots must pay!
newbase_gameplay208=I will protect the Forbidden Area. And if you see these things... You know how to find them right? Take them all!\n\n
newbase_gameplay209=My Gyrafine with a Golden Heart:
newbase_gameplay210=I had a dream where we were running on the beach during the sunset. I will remember that moment forever.
newbase_gameplay211=Gyrafine, I don't know where to go... or when we will meet again, but you'll always be my bright shining star.\n\n
newbase_gameplay212=I miss you. All my love, Elphante\n\n
newbase_gameplay213="You may have lost things, people in your life. But they are captured in your memories forever.“
